calls in statics are limited to constant functions, tuple structs and tuple variants

*can be solved by using const functions, but again the proble is limitation of Rust compiler.
here Rust's const evaluator doesn't have feature to convert a row pointers to reference at compile time. 
So the another solution is Lazy Statics. by using this crate, static variable lazily initializes itself when it is first accessed. So here, we do not want compile time initialization for static variable. This lazy static provide run-time initialization.  (changes in file: Cargo.toml)

How to fix these errors:
*static variables are inintialized at compile time while normal variables are initialized at runtime. This 
evaluation is done by const evaluator, this is a componenet of Rust compiler.
